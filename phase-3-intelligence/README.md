## ðŸ¤– Azure ML â€“ Product Recommendations

Trains a model to suggest items based on previous customer feedback.

- **Tool:** Azure Machine Learning  
- **Input Table:** `Feedback`  
- **Output Table:** `AIRecommendations`  
- **Logic:**  
  - Group feedback by user  
  - Identify top-rated categories  
  - Suggest new products within those categories

## ðŸ“¦ IoT â€“ Product Shelf Tracking

Simulates Raspberry Pi sensors detecting item pickup events from shelves.

- **Platform:** Azure IoT Hub  
- **Simulator:** Python script or Azure Device Simulator  
- **Behavior:**  
  - Sends shelf item movement events (picked/returned)  
  - Maps product to shelf ID  
  - Triggers item detection logic in app
